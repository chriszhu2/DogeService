Created a React web application that extracts faces from user-uploaded photos and identifies human emotions. Depending on the detected emotion, the app will display
a dog with various uplifting responses.

Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node js.) and the Microsoft Azure Face API.
